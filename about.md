This is my personal site. The views reflected here are sometimes mine and sometimes not. These views may even evolve or change over time.

I currently work at [The New York Times][nytimes]. I often solve problems with people, culture and process. I sometimes solve problems code.

I am an average programmer. I keep telling myself that someday I will write better code. I spend the rest of my time being a dad and a husband, at which I am pretty average too. Someday, I hope to be a better dad and a husband too.

I am also love watching sports and am an average club cricketer.

I live in [Hoboken NJ][hoboken]. I grew up in [Delh][delhi] and [Mumbai][mumbai].
