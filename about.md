This is my personal site. The views reflected here are sometimes mine and sometimes not. These views may even evolve or change over time.

A bit more about me. I am an average programmer but these days I spend most of my time fixing culture and people problems at my employer. I dabble in code once in a while but I am often embarassed by the output. I keep telling myself that someday I will write better code.

If there is one thing I am more passionate about than computers, it would be playing and watching cricket. I am pretty interested in other sports too but cricket just takes up most of my time. 

I live in [Hoboken NJ][hoboken]. I grew up in [Delh][delhi]i for the most part but also spent lots of time in [Mumbai][mumbai] since that is where I'd spend all my summers grwoing up and came to love the city over time. I lived in over half a dozen places in the United States before settling in Hoboken for almost a decade now. Having grown up and now living in a large metro has provided me with much gratification to another interest of mine which would be food. I love almost all kinds of food and love being in a large city that is multi-cultural and cosmopolitan.
